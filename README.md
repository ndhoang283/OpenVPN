# OpenVPN
Set up openVPN to access remote server
OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible VPN daemon. OpenVPN 
supports SSL/TLS security, ethernet bridging, TCP or UDP tunnel 
transport through proxies or NAT, support for dynamic IP addresses 
and DHCP, scalability to hundreds or thousands of users, and 
portability to most major OS platforms. 
OpenVPN supports conventional encryption using a pre-shared secret 
key (Static Key mode) or public key security (SSL/TLS mode) using 
client & server certificates. OpenVPN also supports non-encrypted 
TCP/UDP tunnels. 
OpenVPN is designed to work with the TUN/TAP virtual networking 
interface that exists on most platforms. 
Overall, OpenVPN aims to offer many of the key features of IPSec but 
with a relatively lightweight footprint.
